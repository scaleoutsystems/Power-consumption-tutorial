# Predictive Maintenance (TensorFlow/Keras version)
This is an example of simple neural network regression model in federated settings. A normal high-end laptop or a workstation should be able to sustain a few clients. The data partitions are static based on four nodes. We here assume working experience with containers, Docker and docker-compose.

#### NOTE: The model in this example is a simpler version of the model used in the article.  

#### NOTE: The dataset required for this example is not open-source. However, Scaleout support staff can provide more details. Feel free to contact us.

## Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Running the example (pseudo-distributed)
Clone FEDn and locate into this directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn.git
cd fedn/examples/power-consumption-keras
```

### Preparing the environment, the local data, the compute package and seed model

Start by initializing a virtual enviroment with all of the required dependencies.
```sh
bin/init_venv.sh
bin/build.sh
```

The data for this example is not available as open-scource. Please contact the Scaleout support staff for further details. 

### Attach clients 
Here we assume that FEDn network is up and running and you have the client.yaml files. In case you are participating in the Scaleout's workshops, please contact the Scaleout support staff. Following command will connect you client to FEDn network. Please fix the path of the power.npz and client.yaml files according to your local setup.

```sh
 docker run -d -v $PWD/client.yaml:/app/client.yaml \
        -v $PWD/data/p2/:/var/data \ 
        -e ENTRYPOINT_OPTS=--data_path=/var/data/power.npz \ 
        ghcr.io/scaleoutsystems/fedn/fedn:develop-power-consumption \ 
        run client --secure=True --force-ssl -in client.yaml 
```

## Clean up
You can clean up by running `docker stop <container-ID>`.
